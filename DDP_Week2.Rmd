```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Leaflet Library

```{r library, warning=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
```

## Creating Map

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r mapCreate, echo = FALSE}
stmartin_map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles()
stmartin_map <- stmartin_map %>%
  addMarkers(lat=13.8806, lng=120.9248, label = "Basilica of Saint Martin of Tours", labelOptions = labelOptions(noHide = TRUE))
stmartin_map <- stmartin_map %>%
  addCircles(lat=13.8806, lng=120.9248, weight = 1, radius =  100)
stmartin_map
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
